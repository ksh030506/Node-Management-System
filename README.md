# Node-management
 
## Management System
본 프로젝트는 React와 Node 공부 목적으로 만들어진 고객 관리 시스템 (Management System) 입니다.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 스크립트 사용법

프로젝트 디렉토리에서 다음을 실행하세요!

### `yarn start`

개발 모드에서 앱을 실행하고<br />
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)을 열어 브라우저를 확인합니다

수정하면 페이지가 자동으로 새로 고침됩니다.<br />

### `yarn test`

테스트 모드에서 실행합니다.<br />
자세한 내용 확인하기 : [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `yarn build`

프로덕션 용 앱을`build` 폴더에 빌드합니다.<br />
프로덕션 모드에서 React를 올바르게 번들링하고 최상의 성능을 위해 빌드를 최적화합니다.

빌드가 축소되고 파일 이름에 해시가 포함됩니다.<br />
앱을 배포/개발 할 준비가 되었습니다.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
